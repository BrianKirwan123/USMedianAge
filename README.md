This lab was fairly simple and easier for me to understand despite the longevity of the lab. I had a few problems correcting my own syntax errors after I entered various lines of code however other than that I did not have many other problems with the lab. I did however have a more difficult time setting up my legend as for some reason my code was not working properly. There was also a slight issue regarding turning the information I needed into a geoJson file however I was able to fix it after some quick problem solving. In this lab I learned how to add popups and maximize the amount of information that I can share with the public. I am looking forward to using what I have learned in this lab in future labs and the final as I can definitely use this information to further enhance my final project.
