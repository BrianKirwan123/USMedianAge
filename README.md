This map's goal is to further increase the availability of population data in the form of median age to the public. This map can be used to obtain a further understanding of common age groups throughout the United States in order to further understand possible variables that may influence different age groups being more prominent in certain states. Further research would have to go into understanding possible variables and correlations.
